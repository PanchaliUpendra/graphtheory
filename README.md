Graph theory is the mathematical theory of the properties and applications of graphs(network)
The goal of this series is to gain an understanding of how to apply graph theory to real world applications.

## Types of graphs
* undirected graph
* Directed graph
* weighted graphs
### special graphs
* trees
* Rooted trees
* Directed acyclic graphs
* Bipartite graphs
* complete graphs
## Representing graphs

graphs can be represent by using different methods .
#### the following methods used to represent the graphs
